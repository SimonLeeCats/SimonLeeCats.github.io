# What is MySQL?

### Context

To preface this, the reason I'm learning MySQL is to apply to my work at IT. Also I believe generally, it's good to know how databases/servers work, especially if I'm going to configure a SQL server. Despite me mainly being a cyber guy, learning SQL has always been a little side language I've wanted to learn.&#x20;

The purpose of this page is to explain and my learning of SQL. This page won't include the final project. That'll be in the upper left drop down menu.

### MySQL

MySQL is an open-source, relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. It is one of the most popular database systems used in web applications, known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. MySQL is commonly used in conjunction with programming languages such as PHP, Java, and Python to build dynamic websites and applications. Like a spreadsheet, MySQL stores data in a table, consisting of relationships.&#x20;
