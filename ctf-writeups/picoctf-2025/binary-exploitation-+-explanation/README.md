# Binary Exploitation + Explanation

### What is Binary Exploitation?

I'll be using this website: [https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/overview/](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/overview/) and Claude to help me explain.

**Binary Exploitation** is a very general term that encapsules a lot, but if you simplfy it, it's basically finding a vulernaiblity in a complied program. These can range from Buffer overflows, format string bugs, and integer overflows.&#x20;

### What is a register?&#x20;

"A **register** is a location within the processor that is able to store data, much like RAM. Unlike RAM however, accesses to registers are effectively instantaneous, whereas reads from main memory can take hundreds of CPU cycles to return." - CTF101&#x20;

### What is the Stack?&#x20;

The stack is used to store local variables, function parameters, saved registers, pointers, and more, It's a region of memory (RAM) in where it stores temporary data for function execution. It's automatic and fast, but it's buffer memory can be exceeded. For example, if a buffer can hold 64 bytes but you write 80 bytes, those extra 16 bytes overwrite whatever comes after.&#x20;

You might confuse yourself between the Stack and a Heap, but these are still different. As said by Mr.Claude: "The heap requires explicit allocation (malloc) and deallocation (free), and grows upward toward higher addresses. The stack is for short-lived data; the heap is for data that needs to persist beyond a single function call."
