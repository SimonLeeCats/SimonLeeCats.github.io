# Cookie Monster (Easy)

The title of the CTF is "Cookie Monster"... Looks like we'll be using browser cookies then!

I did a previous CTF like this before, so I knew exactly what to do. I pressed "Inspect" on the page intially at first but I saw nothing in the tabs. Then, I tried to log in (as that would how/when  cookies would usually happen)&#x20;

After logging in with some random password/username, I then navigated to the Storage tab, and saw the value followed by secret\_recipe. This was probably the key.

I decoded it from Base-64, and there it was the flag! Probably the fastest CTF I've done.&#x20;
