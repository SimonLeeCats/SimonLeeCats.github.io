I wasn't going document this one, but this one is especially interesting to me. How I figured out this one was first of all, the prompt of an "encoded message" linked to be a cipher. Next, the "-" and the "." reminded me of the beeps used in movies \[where the main character would use Morse code "beeps" to communicate]

I figured that this might be encoded in Morse code, though previously I've never really heard of Morse code being transcribed into text, but it ended up working!
