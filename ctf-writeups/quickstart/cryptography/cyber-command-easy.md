This one was pretty easy. For the first one, I noticed the "0x". This was common in hexadecimals so I went to CyberChef to decode it.&#x20;

The answer for number 1 was "scorpion".&#x20;

For the 2nd question, the "=" at the end would mean it's Base64 most of the time. Using CyberChef again, it returned "scribble"

For  the 3rd one, it was a quite simple Binary conversion.

However, for the 4th challenge, converting it to Binary wasn't enough, and it returned a Base64 encoded message. After decoding it, the answer would be "lollipop"

Overall, pretty easy conversions!
