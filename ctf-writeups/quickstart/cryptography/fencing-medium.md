# Fencing (Medium)

This one was a bit tricky if I didn't read the title . At first, I was a little confused because I thought the keys "3" and "5" was apart of a larger problem, something like utilizing asymmetric encryption.&#x20;

However, reading the title "Fencing", I searched "Fencing" up and found out it was another name for a fairly simple cipher called "Rail Fence".&#x20;

From there, it was pretty obvious in what to do, as I (again) loaded up CyberChef and put "3" as the key for the first problem, and "5" for the second.&#x20;
