# Learning Assembly

### Learning Assembly&#x20;

"Machine Code or Assembly is code which has been formatted for direct execution by a CPU. Machine Code is the reason why readable programming languages like C, when compiled, cannot be reversed into source code (well [Decompilers](https://ctf101.org/reverse-engineering/what-is-assembly-machine-code/) can sort of, but more on that later)." - CTF 101

Assembly in a way is the direct code to the CPU, making it suited for direct optimization or hardware interaction. However, there's two main modes of Assembly, x64 and x84. Assembly x64 is generally used for every CTF and system, as it's just a lot cleaner and more convient than x84. We'll still go through both, but with an emphasis on x64.&#x20;
