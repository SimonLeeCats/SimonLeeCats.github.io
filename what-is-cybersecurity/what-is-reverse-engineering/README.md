What is Reverse Engineering?&#x20;

> The goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.

"Reverse Engineering (RE) is the process of analyzing compiled executables or binaries to understand their inner logic, recover data, or find hidden functionality. In CTF challenges, RE allows you to recover passwords, keys, or validation routines from compiled programs." - CTF Support&#x20;

In otherwords, it's one of the more complex categories of CTFs, utilizing disassmeblers, registers, decompliers, and debugging runtime behavior. It's essential to understand Assmebly (x86-64) along side the mulitutude of tools reverse engineering has.&#x20;

When you disassemble a program, you looking for hidden vulnerabilities in the source code. These programs range from malware, complied binaries (just the executebale), and firmeware.&#x20;
